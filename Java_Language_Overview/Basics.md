# Back To The Basics
Just some useful tidbits about programming, terminology, etc.  
Basically, I hear these words *A LOT* so what do they mean?

### Running a Java Program
* Java isn't compiled down to machine level native code, rather it is compiled
to _Java Bytecode_ which isn't is consumed by the **JVM**.
* A **Java Runtime** is needed to actually execute Java Bytecode, a common one being the JRE
 * Contains the JVM + Runtime Libraries (Java Standard Libraries)

### _Aside:_ JDK vs. JRE vs. JVM
A lot of times I get confused with these three, so to put succintly these are the differences:
*JDK*: Contains the JRE, java compiler (javac), and other development tools
*JRE*: Contains the JVM, runtime libraries
*JVM*: Used to compile/interpret Java Bytecodes for execution by the host machine

### Terminology
*Statement*: An executable snippet of code that represents a complete command
*Primitive*: A basic data type that is built into the language
*Expression*: A simple value or set of operations that produces a value 
*Literal*: Simplest form of an expression, represents a value within source code (fixed)
* `int x = 1`: `x` represents an integer variable initialized to the integer literal `1`

### Programming Paradigms: _Object Oriented_ vs. _Procedural_
*Procedural Decomposition*: Breaking down a program into tasks / subtasks
*Object-Oriented Decomposition*: Breaking down a program into Objects (hold data + actions)
